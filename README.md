# Yuriy Chamkoriyski and Bogdan Stojanovic Microverse Awesome Books project

> The first own code review for a trial project - Product page.

![screenshot](./img/app-screeshot.JPG)

Here are the main requirements for the project.

- Create a new empty repo.
- Copy your code from the project that you completed during the Admissions Trial
- Create a new branch for your copied code.
- Open a pull request.
- Play the role of the Code Reviewer:
  1. Follow the list from the article "How to give a code review?".
  2. Check if you have used semantic HTML tags.
  3. Check if you applied HTML & CSS best practices.
- Add as many comments as possible in the given time and finish your review. Remember to add a minimum of 2 comments - you will definitely find something that could have been done better!
- Copy a link to the pull request and ask for a code review in your Student Dashboard as usual. (The only difference will be that the Code Reviewer won't check your code but the review you performed - isn't it a code review inception? ;)
